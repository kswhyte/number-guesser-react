# NumberGuesser - React

Here, I re-built a small game based on the original [NumberGuesser](https://github.com/kswhyte/number-guesser) where the user picks a number between 1 and 100, this time using ReactJS and ES6. Upon entering the number, the application displays feedback indicating how close their guess was to a random number that was generated. 

After the guess is submitted, the 'max' and 'min' were increased and decreased respectively to add a greater difficulty after each successful guess. Users were also able to customize the range at their own volition.
